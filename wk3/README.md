# Week 3 – Animation

## Module
Computer Graphics Programming

## Task
Create a simple animated shape using C# Windows Forms.

## Description
This exercise introduces animation using WinForms by updating object
coordinates over time with a Timer. A circle is animated across the
window and bounces off the edges of the form.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Timer-based animation
- Use of Invalidate() to trigger redraws
- Continuous rendering using OnPaint()
- Basic collision detection
- 2D coordinate manipulation

## Files Included
- `Animation.cs` – animation logic and drawing code
- `Program.cs` – application entry point
- `CGP.exe` – compiled executable

## Output
Running the executable displays a circle that moves smoothly across the
window and bounces when it reaches the edges.
