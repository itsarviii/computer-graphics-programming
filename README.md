# Computer Graphics Programming

This repository contains my portfolio of practical work for the module
**Computer Graphics Programming**. Each folder represents a weekly practical
exercise and demonstrates key graphics programming concepts implemented in C#.

## Module Overview
The module introduces fundamental principles of computer graphics, including
2D and 3D drawing techniques, animation, transformations, and rendering
algorithms. All practical work is implemented using C# and Windows Forms.

## Repository Structure

- `Wk1`  
  Introduction to WinForms and basic drawing using the Graphics object.

- `Wk2`  
  Line drawing techniques and basic 2D graphics.

- `Wk3`  
  Simple animation using timers and redraw events.

- `Wk4`  
  Techniques for reducing flicker during rendering.

- `Wk5`  
  Representation and manipulation of geometric shapes.

- `Wk6`  
  Mathematical foundations for graphics programming.

- `Wk7`  
  Translation, rotation, and scaling.

## Technologies Used
- C#
- .NET Framework
- Windows Forms (WinForms)
- System.Drawing

## Notes
Executable files are included where required by the practical specifications.
Each weekly folder contains a README describing the task and learning outcomes.
