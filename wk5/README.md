# Week 5 – Geometrical Shapes

## Module
Computer Graphics Programming

## Task
Implement the Bresenham (Midpoint) Circle Algorithm to draw a circle
without using built-in ellipse drawing functions.

## Description
This exercise demonstrates manual rasterisation of a circle using
integer-based decision parameters. The algorithm calculates one
octant of the circle and uses symmetry to plot the remaining points.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Bresenham’s circle algorithm
- Midpoint decision parameter
- Pixel plotting using integer arithmetic
- Exploiting symmetry in 2D graphics
- Manual shape representation

## Files Included
- `GeometricaShapes.cs` – circle drawing algorithm
- `Program.cs` – application entry point
- `CGP.exe` – compiled executable

## Output
Running the executable displays a circle drawn using the
Bresenham circle algorithm.
