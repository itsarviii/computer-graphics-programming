# Week 1 – Introduction to WinForms

## Module
Computer Graphics Programming

## Task
Draw a circle inside a square using C# Windows Forms.

## Description
This exercise introduces Windows Forms (WinForms) and basic graphics drawing
using the `System.Drawing` library. A square is drawn using a rectangle, and a
circle is drawn inside it by using an ellipse with the same bounding dimensions.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Creating a WinForms application
- Using the Graphics object in `OnPaint()`
- Hierarchical coordinate system (top-left origin)
- Drawing basic geometric shapes
- Understanding how an ellipse can represent a circle

## Files Included
- `Introduction.cs` – source code for the drawing logic
- `Program.cs` – application entry point
- `CGP.exe` – compiled executable

## Output
Running the executable displays a window containing several shapes, including
a circle perfectly inscribed inside a square.
