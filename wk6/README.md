# Week 6 – Essential Maths

## Module
Computer Graphics Programming

## Task
Implement 2D rotation using matrix-based transformation.

## Description
This exercise demonstrates how geometric transformations can be
performed using matrix multiplication. A triangle is rotated around
the origin using a rotation matrix and then translated to the centre
of the screen for display.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- 2D rotation matrix
- Trigonometric functions (sine and cosine)
- Coordinate transformation
- Animation using timer-based updates
- Separation of model and screen coordinates

## Files Included
- `EssentialMaths.cs` – matrix rotation implementation
- `Program.cs` – application entry point
- `CGP.exe` – compiled executable

## Output
Running the executable displays a triangle rotating smoothly
around its centre using matrix-based transformation.
